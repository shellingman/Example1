## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r boxplot}

data("mtcars")

boxplot(mtcars$hp ~ factor(mtcars$cyl), main= "Boxplot HP by Cylinders"
        , ylab = "Horse Power", xlab = "Number of Cylinders")



```
